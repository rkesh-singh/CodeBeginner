Snowflake streaming bug
------------------------

1. With standalone scala program Snowflake streaming was working fine.After integrating in product data was loading
to staging but rest notification to snowpipe was failing.

Debug:
-------
Took Snowflake SDK Ingest code from github and found that rest request was not proper.


Snowflake random null data while fetching huge datasets
-------------------------------------------------------

When we were reading huge datasets few column ecords was coming null randomly.

Debug:
-------
In Snowflake JDBC release notes we found that issue exist and got fixed in further build.


2. Customer Issue.

Customer was not able to test with proxy enabled.
GCS spent 3 weeks with customer, customer was at verge to close the deal.

Query came to RnD, I checked the release notes of SNowflake JDBC third party and found support of feature enabled form latets version.
