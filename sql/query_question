1. Find duplicate records in table?

	SELECT EmpId, Project, Salary, COUNT(*)
	FROM EmployeeSalary
	GROUP BY EmpId, Project, Salary
	HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

2. Find total count for above query?

	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT  * FROM EMPLOYEES GROUP BY NAME HAVING COUNT(*) > 1) AS T1

3. Write a SQL query to fetch all the Employees who are also managers from EmployeeDetails table.

	SELECT E_ID FROM EMPLOYEEDETAILS E INNER JOIN EMPLOYEEDETAILS M ON E.E_ID = M.MANAGER_ID

4. Write a SQL query to remove duplicates from a table without using temporary table.

	DELETE FROM EmployeeSalary  
	WHERE EmpId IN (
	SELECT EmpId 
	FROM EmployeeSalary       
	GROUP BY Project, Salary
	HAVING COUNT(*) > 1));

	THIS WILL DELETE ALL RECORDS WHICH ARE PRESENT MORE THAN 1 TIME.

7. Write SQL query to find the nth highest salary from table.

	SELECT Salary FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT N-1,1;

		LIMIT A, B
			A - OFFSET
			B - LIMIT
			
	SELECT Salary
	FROM Worker W1
	WHERE n-1 = (
	 SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT ( W2.Salary ) )
	 FROM Worker W2
	 WHERE W2.Salary >= W1.Salary
	 );
	
	
8. Write a SQL query to find current date-time.

	mySQL- SELECT NOW()
	       SELECT CURDATE()
	
	ORACLE- SELECT SYSDATE FOM DUAL;
	
9. Write An SQL Query To Print First Three Characters Of  FIRST_NAME From Worker Table.
	
	SELECT SUBSTRING(FIRST_NAME, 1, 3) FROM WORKER

10. Write An SQL Query To Find The Position Of The Alphabet (‘A’) In The First Name Column ‘Amitabh’ From Worker Table.

	Select INSTR(FIRST_NAME, BINARY'a') from Worker where FIRST_NAME = 'Amitabh'
	
		The INSTR method is in case-sensitive by default.
		Using Binary operator will make INSTR work as the case-sensitive function.
		
11. LTRIM AND RTRIM FOR REMOVING WHITE SPACES

	Select RTRIM(FIRST_NAME) from Worker;
	
12. Write An SQL Query To Print The FIRST_NAME And LAST_NAME From Worker Table Into A Single Column COMPLETE_NAME. 
    A Space Char Should Separate Them.
    
    	SELECT CONCAT(FIRST_NAME, ' ', LAST_NAME) AS COMPLETE_NAME FROM WORKER;
	
13. Write An SQL Query To Print Details Of The Workers Who Are Also Managers.

	SELECT DISTINCT W.FIRST_NAME, T.WORKER_TITLE
	FROM Worker W
	INNER JOIN Title T
	ON W.WORKER_ID = T.WORKER_REF_ID
	AND T.WORKER_TITLE in ('Manager');

14. Write An SQL Query To Show Only Even/Odd Rows From A Table

	EVEN- SELECT * FROM WORKER WHERE MOD (WORKER_ID, 2) = 0
	ODD-  SELECT * FROM WORKER WHERE MOD (WORKER_ID, 2) <> 0

15. Write An SQL Query To Fetch The List Of Employees With The Same Salary.

	Select distinct W.WORKER_ID, W.FIRST_NAME, W.Salary 
	from Worker W, Worker W1 
	where W.Salary = W1.Salary 
	and W.WORKER_ID != W1.WORKER_ID;

16. Write An SQL Query To Print The Name Of Employees Having The Highest Salary In Each Department.

	SELECT t.DEPARTMENT,t.FIRST_NAME,t.Salary 
	from(SELECT max(Salary) as TotalSalary,DEPARTMENT from Worker group by DEPARTMENT) as TempNew 
	Inner Join Worker t on TempNew.DEPARTMENT=t.DEPARTMENT and TempNew.TotalSalary=t.Salary;
	
17. Write An SQL Query To Fetch Three Max Salaries From A Table.

	 SELECT distinct Salary from worker a WHERE 3 >= (SELECT count(distinct Salary) 
	 from worker b WHERE a.Salary <= b.Salary) order by a.Salary desc;
 
 	SELECT DISTINCT SALARY FROM WORKER ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT 3

18. Write An SQL Query To Fetch Three MIN Salaries From A Table.

	 SELECT distinct Salary from worker a WHERE 3 >= (SELECT count(distinct Salary) 
	 from worker b WHERE a.Salary >= b.Salary) order by a.Salary desc;
	 
	 SELECT DISTINCT SALARY FROM WORKER ORDER BY SALARY ASC LIMIT 3
